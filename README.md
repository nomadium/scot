# Scot
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nomadium/scot.png)](https://travis-ci.org/nomadium/scot)

yet another git implementation in ruby

git is defined by his creator as a "stupid content tracker", hence this gem is named scot, just that.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'scot'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install scot

## Usage

You can use scot via command line interface or you can import it in your project just by requiring the scot module.

```ruby
require "scot"
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
